Emotion Engine was an experiment to create an easy to use PHP Web Framework in short time.  It was developed by [Dal Rupnik](https://github.com/legoless) for his Bachelor of Science Thesis in 2011. The original paper is published on [Digital Library of University of Maribor](https://dk.um.si/Dokument.php?id=25670&lang=slv) in Slovenian language.

# Framework

Framework was inspired by many top existing frameworks at the time such as [CodeIgniter](http://www.codeigniter.com), [Symfony](http://symfony.com), [Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com) and [Zend](http://framework.zend.com). It implements or builds on many ideas put forward by other respective frameworks.
