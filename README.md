Emotion Engine was an experiment to create an easy to use PHP Web Framework in very short amount of time.  It was developed by [Dal Rupnik](https://github.com/legoless) for Bachelor of Science Thesis in 2011. The original paper is published on [Digital Library of University of Maribor](https://dk.um.si/Dokument.php?id=25670&lang=slv) in Slovenian language.

# Framework

Framework was inspired by many top existing frameworks at the time such as [CodeIgniter](http://www.codeigniter.com), [Symfony](http://symfony.com), [Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com) and [Zend](http://framework.zend.com). It implements or builds on many ideas put forward by other respective frameworks. The main goal behind the development of the framework was to keep it's memory footprint small and very fast loading time, while having all the benefits of many components used in large frameworks.
